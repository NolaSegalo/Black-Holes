It contains small solar system bodies made mostly of ices. The ices are frozen volatiles (gases) such as methane, ammonia, nitrogen and water. It also is home to the known dwarf planets Pluto, Haumea and Makemake.</p> <h2 style="color:white">Kuiper Belt <span style="color:lightblue">Location</span></h2> <p style="color:white">The Kuiper Belt extends from roughly the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU out to about 55 astronomical units from the Sun. The main body of this belt covers much of this region, ranging from nearly 40 AU to 48 AU. It is thick in most places and astronomers have described it as being more torus-shaped than a belt would be. Other regions of the Kuiper Belt include a disk of scattered objects that are part of a population of worlds called Trans-Neptunian Objects.</p> <br> <h2 style="color:white">Facts About The Kuiper Belt</h2> <ul> <li>The Kuiper Belt could contain hundreds of thousands of icy bodies that range in size from small chunks of ice to worldlets larger than 100 kilometres across.</li> <li>Astronomers have tracked most short-period comets from their origins in the Kuiper Belt. These are comets with orbital periods of 200 years or less.</li> <li>There could be more than a trillion comet nuclei in the main body of the Kuiper Belt. </li> <li>The largest Kuiper Belt Objects are Pluto, Quaoar, Makemake, Haumea, Ixion, and Varuna. These are often also referred to as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs).</li> <li>The first mission to the Kuiper Belt and beyond will fly by Pluto in July 2015. It’s called New Horizons and will survey Pluto, Charon and the other moons before heading out to study other Kuiper Belt Objects in the future.</li> <li>Astronomers have found structures similar to our Kuiper Belt around at least nine other stars. Hubble Space Telescope imaged discs around the stars HD 138664 in the constellation Lupus, and HD 53143 in the constellation Carina.</li> <li>The ices in the Kuiper Belt date back to the formation of the solar system. They contain clues to conditions in the early solar nebula.</li> </ul> <br><br> <img class="size-full wp-image-2918" src="http://c.dryicons.com/files/graphics_previews/DD-Space-Background-44012-Preview.jpg" alt="The Asteroid Belt" width="800" height="468"> <h2 style="color:white"> What Is The <span style="color:lightblue"> Asteroid Belt?</span></h2> <p style="color:white">The vast majority of asteroids in the solar system are found in a region of the solar system out beyond Mars. They form the Asteroid Belt. Others orbit in near-Earth space and a few migrate or are thrown out to the outer solar system by gravitational interactions. The four largest asteroids in the belt are Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. They contain half the mass of the entire belt. The rest of the mass is contained in countless smaller bodies. There was a theory once that if you combined all the asteroids they would make up the missing “Fifth” rocky planet. Planetary scientists estimate that if you could put all that material together that exists there today, it would make a tiny world smaller than Earth’s moon.</p> <h2 style="color:white">Asteroid Belt <span style="color:lightblue">Location</span></h2> <p style="color:white">The Asteroid Belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. That places it between 2.2 and 3.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. The belt is about 1 AU thick. The average distance between objects in the Asteroid Belt is quite large. If you could stand on an asteroid and look around, the next one would be too far away to see very well.</p> <br> <h2 style="color:white">Facts About The Asteroid Belt</h2> <ul> <li>Asteroid Belt objects are made of rock and stone. Some are solid objects, while others are orbiting “rubble piles”.</li> <li>The Asteroid Belt contains billions and billions of asteroids.</li> <li>Some asteroids in the Belt are quite large, but most range in size down to pebbles. </li> <li>The asteroid 1/Ceres is also designated as a dwarf planet, the largest one in the inner solar system.</li> <li>We know of at least 7,000 asteroids.</li> <li>The Asteroid Belt may contain many objects, but they are spread out over a huge area of space. This has allowed spacecraft to move through this region without hitting anything.</li> <li>Asteroids get their names from suggestions by their discoverers and are also given a number.</li> <li>The formation of Jupiter disrupted the formation of any worlds in the Asteroid Belt region by scattering asteroids away. This caused them to collide and break into smaller pieces.</li> <li>Gravitational influences can move asteroids out of the Belt.</li> <li>The Asteroid Belt is often referred to as the “Main Belt” to distinguish it from other groups of asteroids such as the Lagrangians and Centaurs.</li> </ul> <img class="size-full wp-image-2918" src="https://w-dog.net/wallpapers/15/14/362266456980463/ios7-ios-7-iphone-apple-space-new-stunning-blue-best-pretty-amazing-blue-space-active-marvelous-beautiful-mac-os-osx-os-x-mavericks-desktop-think-bright-up-cool-goodfon.jpg" width="800" height="468"> <br><br> </body> </html>
